Sick of your computer running like molasses? Tired of having to perform
that annual (semi-annual?) reformat and installation of your operating
system? Do you wish your computer just ran faster? Well maybe some free
alternative lightweight software will solve your problem! On the other
hand, if you enjoy the time you have to make coffee while you load that
simple .PDF file, please stop reading now.

I have a fairly complex, yet powerful, Windows box that I run as my
primary machine and it runs great. Now this is by no coincidence, it’s
taken some hard work to make this thing run like a well oiled machine. I
do, however, owe a great deal of thanks to the plethora of free (as in
beer), lightweight software I have installed. What software you might
ask? Well here’s a list I’ve compiled of some of the best software I’ve
run into that will keep your computer from slowing down and your
resources free so you can do more important things, like surf for porn.

I have broken this article into four parts to make it easier on both
you, the reader, and me. As I publish the other sections of this
article, I will add a link to them.

\#\# [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/fx/)

\*\*Replaces:\*\* Internet Explorer  
\*\*Alternatives:\*\* [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/),
[Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome), [Opera](http://www.opera.com/)  
\*\*Pros:\*\* Speed, Extensions, Open Source

Firefox is an open source alternative web browser by Mozilla that
provides a much better web browsing experience than it’s defacto
alternative, Internet Explorer. Some of the key features of Firefox
include enhanced security features, increased speed, and virtually
limitless customization through themes and extensions. Be sure to pay
attention as Mozilla will soon be releasing Firefox 3.1 which is
supposed to include a few new features and even more speed improvements.

Recommended Extensions: [Adblock
Plus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/),
Filterset.G Updater, Foxmarks Bookmark Sync, and IE Tab

\#\# [Thunderbird](http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/)

\*\*Replaces:\*\* Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express  
\*\*Alternatives:\*\* [Gmail](https://www.gmail.com/), [Yahoo!
Mail](https://mail.yahoo.com/), [Windows Live
Hotmail](www.hotmail.com/)  
\*\*Pros:\*\* Extensions, Open Source  
\*\*Cons:\*\* No Exchange support (yet)

Another great product from the Mozilla team, the Thunderbird email
client, is a great alternative to the pre-installed Outlook Express and,
with the right extensions, an adequate replacement for Microsoft
Outlook. The biggest drawback with Thunderbird right now is the lack of
MS Exchange support, but (as far as I know) they plan on changing that
with the release of Thunderbird 3.0.

Recommended Extensions: Lightning, Provider, Enigmail

\#\# [Pidgin](http://www.pidgin.im)

\*\*Replaces:\*\* AOL Instant Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger, MSN
Messenger  
\*\*Alternatives:\*\* [Trillian](http://www.trillian.im/)  
\*\*Pros:\*\* Ad Free, Plugins, Open Source  
\*\*Cons:\*\* No Video Chat (at the moment)

Pidgin is a free instant messaging platform designed to centralize the
vast array of popular instant messaging protocols in to one easy to use
program. Pidgin allows you to be logged on to multiple instant messaging
systems at the same time through one simple user interface. The
following protocols are supported: AIM, MSN, Yahoo!, Gtalk/Jabber, ICQ,
Gadu Gadu, and more…

\#\# [OpenOffice.org](http://www.openoffice.org)

\*\*Replaces:\*\* Microsoft Office  
\*\*Alternatives:\*\* N/A  
\*\*Pros:\*\* Plugins, Open Source, Can read from and write to MS
Office files  
\*\*Cons:\*\* (Very) Slight Learning Curve

Just get a new computer and don’t want to fork out another \$150 for
word processing software? Well then OpenOffice.org is your answer!
OpenOffice.org is a free and open source office software suite. Included
are applications for word processing, spreadsheets, presentations,
graphics, databases and more. And just when you thought it couldn’t get
any better, OpenOffice.org 3.0 is currently in it’s third revision of a
release candidate and will hopefully be out with a final version soon.

\#\# [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

\*\*Replaces:\*\* Notepad  
\*\*Alternatives:\*\*
[Notepad2](http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html),
[Jedit](http://www.jedit.org/)  
\*\*Pros:\*\* Lightweight, Plugins, Open Source  
\*\*Cons:\*\* N/A

Notepad++ is one of many Notepad replacements. Unlike typical Notepad,
however, Notepad++ features many front and back end improvements. On the
front end you have such noticeable features like tabbed files, line
numbers, syntax highlighting, syntax folding, and code completion. In
terms of back end improvements, the following is taken from the
Notepad++ homepage:

\> Based on a powerful editing component Scintilla, Notepad++ is written
in C++ and uses pure Win32 API and STL which ensures a higher execution
speed and smaller program size.

\#\# [Foxit Reader](http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/reader/)

\*\*Replaces:\*\* Adobe PDF Reader  
\*\*Alternatives:\*\* N/A  
\*\*Pros:\*\* Lightweight, Fast, Plugins, Annotation Tool  
\*\*Cons:\*\* Occasional Rendering Mistakes (very rare)

Of all the software on this list, you will probably notice the biggest
difference in speed and performance when using Foxit Reader. Compared to
the “official” Adobe PDF Reader, Foxit Reader is incredibly small (just
over 2.5MB), blazing fast, and its core function is compatible with PDF
Standard 1.7. Foxit Reader also comes standard with an annotation tool,
unlike Adobe, who would charge you \$299 for their pro version to get
feature.

Lastly, CutePDF Writer is a very lightweight PDF creation program. After

3. All you have to do is 1) choose the print option from the document
