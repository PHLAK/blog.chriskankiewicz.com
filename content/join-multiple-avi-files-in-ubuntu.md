I was just in a bit of a pickle and needed to join two .avi files
together while in Ubuntu.Â  There are a number of solutions out there,
but the most simple solution I could find was via \`avimerge\`. Here's
how I did it.

\#\# Install avimerge

sudo apt-get update  
sudo apt-get install transcode-utils

\#\# Merge your files

avimerge -i input\_file1.avi input\_file2.avi -o output\_file.avi

It's as simple as that. I did this in Ubuntu 10.10, but this should work
for older versions as well.
