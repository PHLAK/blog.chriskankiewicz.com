I was just in a bit of a pickle and needed to join two .avi files together while
in Ubuntu.Â  There are a number of solutions out there, but the most simple
solution I could find was via `avimerge`. Here's how I did it.

## Install avimerge

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install transcode-utils

## Merge your files

    avimerge -i input_file1.avi input_file2.avi -o output_file.avi

It's as simple as that. I did this in Ubuntu 10.10, but this should work for
older versions as well.
