So, Gizmodo had a list of 50 skills every geek should know. Seeing as I
choose to don the title of “Geek” I feel obligated to see how many of
these skills I posses.

Skills marked in \*\*Bold\*\* are skill I have and have used, or have
all the essential knowledge to perform without reference. My notes are
[encased in square brackets].
