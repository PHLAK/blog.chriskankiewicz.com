I went to the Verizon store at 10am the day of release and they said
they had sold out \~2 hours before I got there. I was able to order one
and they were nice enough to write off the rebate right away and
overnight me a Storm directly from the factory. By noon the following
day I had my Storm and the following are photos of the unboxing. I know
this is rather late, but like they say, better late than never.

After my phone finished booting I forgot all about taking pictures. The
following pictures were taken about a week later after I had been using
the phone for a while.

I’ve now had my Storm for just over 3 weeks and I love it! Every aspect
of it is great. Sure there are some problems with the software, but
nothing major or inconvinient, and since it’s software, there’s a good
chance it will be fixed in the near future. Bottom line though, I don’t
know how I lived without a BlackBerry up until now!
