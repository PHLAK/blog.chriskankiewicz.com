I went to the Verizon store at 10am the day of release and they said they had
sold out ~2 hours before I got there. I was able to order one and they were nice
enough to write off the rebate right away and overnight me a Storm directly from
the factory. By noon the following day I had my Storm and the following are
photos of the unboxing. I know this is rather late, but like they say, better
late than never.

After my phone finished booting I forgot all about taking pictures. The
following pictures were taken about a week later after I had been using the
phone for a while.

I’ve now had my Storm for just over 3 weeks and I love it! Every aspect of it is
great. Sure there are some problems with the software, but nothing major or
inconvinient, and since it’s software, there’s a good chance it will be fixed in
the near future. Bottom line though, I don’t know how I lived without a
BlackBerry up until now!
