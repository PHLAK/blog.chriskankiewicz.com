**NOTE:** The latest version of this script can always be found here:

With this update I have drastically reduced and simpified the code to produce
the same results. I did some rigorous testing of my own to make sure this script
will calculate the correct date, but that doesn’t mean it’s bullet-proof. If you
find a bug, please email me so I can fix it.

### first-friday.php

Somewhere along the lines of moving my blog from one site/platform to another I
lost this sample of code. See link above for the latest version of this script.
